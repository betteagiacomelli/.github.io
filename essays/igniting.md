I have had the privilege of building a successful career in the areas of Accounting, Human Resources, Recruitment, Systems Implementation, Operations, Business Strategy and Process Improvement with out having obtained
a degree. From a young age, I have managed international corporate teams, as well as built and grew two companies through my inherent ability to build relationships, understand business, and learn quickly.

Technology has always resonated with me since the start of the Digital Revolution. I have observed the business environment evolve and I witnessed more and more organizations adapt to the changes, as we entered into 
the Cyber Revolution. I recognize that it is important to be adept, and acquire technological skills to remain successful and relevant. 

I belive people should always strive to continuously learn new things. Learning new things to complement your existing knowledge is what growth and success means to me. I have decided to enhance my skillset to encompass all aspects of business and complete my degree in Management Information Systems. I hope to acquire new skills and knowledge through the MIS program and completing the BAM program at UH.
